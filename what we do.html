	<h1>Tips for prevention</h1>
	<h3>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
	<p>Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.

You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap. Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything including your phone or laptop.</p>
<h3>2. Avoid touching your face</h3>
	<p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like a doorknob, gas pump handle, or your cell phone.

Avoid touching any part of your face or head including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.</p>
<h3>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
<p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin to skin contact can pass SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.

</p>
<h3>4. Don’t share personal items</h3>
<p>Do not share personal items like phones, makeup, or combs. It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.</p>
<h3>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h3>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough or sneeze. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.

Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p>
